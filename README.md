##PersistChat - mobile app using CoreData


This mobile application's model is rooted in CoreData and the application mimicks the Facebook Messenger application.

The application loads a dummy set of friends with messages. You can..

* select the friend
* read their messages
* send your own messages by inputing text at the bottom
* simulate new messages that delayed in sending to you from that friend
* simulate new friends sending messages in the Recent tab section.
* see the last message from the friend in the Recent list

####When the app loads you see CoreData displaying the friends that have sent messages.
